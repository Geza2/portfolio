# Project and Work Portfolio

### University of Vienna (2024 - Actual): MSc, Data Science
#### Mining Massive Data Programming Assignments
- **PA1:** Developed a genre-classifying algorithm using Locality Sensitive Hashing LSH with a random projection matrix.
- **PA2:** Large-scale SVM training with own implementation of optimizers (SGD, Adagrad, etc.). Implemented RFF Kernels for SVMs.
- **PA3:** Built custom KMeans clustering algorithm with LSH and coresets.
- Designed everything in object-oriented manner in Python, and evaluated performance on large-scale, high-dimensional datasets [Link to Repo](https://github.com/kerim325/Assignments_Mining-Massive-Data)

#### Visual and Exploratory Data Analysis
- Created interactive data visualizations and dashboards using Tableau
- **A3:** Designed both a *white-hat affective* visualization [white-hat affective](https://public.tableau.com/views/A3-affectivewhitehat/affectivewhitehat?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to subtly influence users' emotions through and a *black-hat* visualization [black-hat](https://public.tableau.com/views/A3-blackhat_17461051437810/blackhat?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) that intentionally misleads viewers.
- **A5:** Developed two interactive dashboards tailored for different user groups [A5 Dashboards](https://public.tableau.com/views/A5_Sumegi_Geza/Dashboard1WWFActivists?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link):
 - For data journalists: Built a dashboard forecasting disaster risk levels for Austria in the upcoming year, and highlighted Austria's standing across key climate indicators.
 - For WWF activists: Created a dashboard that allows them to explore climate-related indicators for all countries, with emphasis on the most vulnerable or heavily affected regions.
